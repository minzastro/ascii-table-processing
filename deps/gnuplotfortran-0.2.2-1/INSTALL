    I would strongly welcome bug reports, feature enhancement requests, compliments, donations and job offers :) My email address : msc@ieee.org

The following procedure assumes that you have downloaded my fortranposix library and installed it appropriately (http://sourceforge.net/projects/fortranposix).

1. Edit the supplied Makefile if necessary.

2. Run make :
		gmake

3. This will generate a shared library : libgnuplotfortran.so and a few .mod files.

4. Move the shared library to some place within your LD_LIBRARY_PATH. You may want to make it available to everyone, so place it in a system wide path.

5. Move the .mod files to some standard location on your system. You may want to make these available to everyone, so place them in a system wide path.

5. Read the file gnuplot_fortran95_interfaces.f90 to learn about the usage of each function and to obtain the interface.

6. Append the -lgnuplotfortran -lfortranposix options to your linker and three lines to the code where you want to use the library :

	use datatypes
	use gnuplot_module_data
	use gnuplot_module

You may also need to specify an addition search path for library files (usually -L), depending upon your fortran compiler.


Enjoy !
